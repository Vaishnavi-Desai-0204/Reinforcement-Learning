# Reinforcement-Learning

cart.py: The main script that sets up the CartPole environment, implements the Q-learning algorithm, and allows for training and testing of the agent.
cartpole.npy: The saved Q-table learned during training.
README.md: A README file providing an overview of the project, instructions on how to use the code, and any additional information.
MountainCar Environment using Q-learning:
This repository contains the implementation of the MountainCar environment using Q-learning. The code is written in Python and consists of the following files:

mountaincar.py: The main script that sets up the MountainCar environment, implements the Q-learning algorithm, and enables training and testing of the agent.
car.npy: The saved Q-table learned during training.
README.md: A README file providing an overview of the project, instructions on how to use the code, and any additional information.
These repositories serve as a starting point for working with the CartPole and MountainCar environments and implementing Q-learning algorithms to train an agent. They provide a basic structure and implementation that can be expanded upon or modified as needed.
